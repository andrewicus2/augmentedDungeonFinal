    <p>
      You see that each person sitting in a chair is wearing a virtual reality headset and completely slumped over. You decide to walk up to the head that looked familiar.
    </p>
    <div id="onlyWhenPowerOff" style="display:none;">
    <p>
      You pull the figure upright and rip off their headset to get a better look at the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      You stop. It's like looking in a mirror. You are looking at yourself. The room goes dark.
    </p>
  </div>
    <div id="withPower" style="display:none;">
      <p>You hear an alarm go off in the distance, footsteps run up behind you. You whip around just in time to see a figure tackle you. Darkness.
